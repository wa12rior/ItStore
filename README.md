# ItStore
The ItStore project on Udacity/Google Android Basics Nanodegree.

## Overview

The goal was to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory. In Stage 1, I designed and implemented the backend database that stores information about the products and suppliers. In 2nd stage, I built out the app UI for users to add and remove inventory.
